Tiny homepage built for 10k Apart 2011.

## Getting started

Getting started with Lamdot, a tiny homepage, is really simple. Click the blue ? in the top right for a quick intro, or read on here.

### Adding a link

Click or tap the green + in the top right.

Name your link in the "Website" box, eg `Tumblr`.

Enter the url of the website in the "Link" box, eg `tumblr.com`.

Click the green plus directly to the right. This will add your link to the list, and you will see it appear in the list of three big links.

### Removing a link

The red x in the top right gives you access to a menu from which you can remove, reset and export your links.

Clicking "Remove a link" allows you to select a link to remove from your list. After clicking, the links will change to red. Simply click on the one you wish to remove, and click "Ok". You're done :)

### Exporting your links

More documentation coming soon, but for now:

Open the x menu and click "Export". This will retrieve a `bit.ly` link which, when opened in another browser, will retrieve your list of links. Simple, right?

### Resetting all links

In the x menu you will find an option to reset your links. This, after checking that you want to do it, will restore your links to the default three and show you the intro text again.
